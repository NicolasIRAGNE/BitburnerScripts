# Personal scripts for Bitburner

they're not very good but they're good enough for me.

mostly made this repo for personal use, nothing revolutionary here

mostly useless stuff, most interesting is probably:

[Workload Manager](./lib/workload_manager.js) ([Documentation](https://nicolasiragne.github.io/BitburnerScripts/WorkloadManager.html))

[Profiling and Testing library](./lib/testing.js) ([Documentation, kinda](https://nicolasiragne.github.io/BitburnerScripts/global.html))
